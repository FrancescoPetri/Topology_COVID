# Topology_COVID

This repository was created with the aim to share the code used in two our publications:

 - BEYOND COVID-19 PANDEMIC: TOPOLOGY-AWARE OPTIMIZATION OF VACCINATION STRATEGY FOR MINIMIZING VIRUS SPREADING

Here, we present the benefits of a topology-aware versus an age-based vaccination strategy to mitigate the spreading of the virus.

  - Disease Spreading Modeling and Analysis: A Survey
  
Here, we focus on and discuss some graph-based epidemiological models and show how their use may significantly improve the disease spreading control. We offer some examples related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how to generalize them to other diseases.


# CODE

We provide two different Jupyter notebooks, that can be easily open using GoogleColab

 - Non_markov_SIR_covid.ipynb - This notebook refers to "BEYOND COVID-19 PANDEMIC: TOPOLOGY-AWARE OPTIMIZATION OF VACCINATION STRATEGY FOR MINIMIZING VIRUS SPREADING". It carries simulations with a fixed recovery rate of 14 days, with the possibility to modify both newtork topology and simulation parameters.
